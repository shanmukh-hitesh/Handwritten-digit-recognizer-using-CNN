# Handwritten-digit-recognizer-using-CNN
This project demonstrates a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that is trained on the MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits. It also allows you to input your own digit image (28x28 grayscale) [0-9] and predict the digit using the trained model.
